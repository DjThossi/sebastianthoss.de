            I didn't sleep well last night. Somehow I was lying awkwardly, my neck and back didn't really want to wake up. But the breakfast on the hotel roof was all the better for it – even though unfortunately none of the dishes were labeled. That did stop me from boldly trying a few things.
        </p>
        <p>
            Quickly took a few more photos from above – the same perspective as yesterday evening, but now in daylight. Then it was already time: I had booked a guided tour through the Hagia Sophia. When I arrived at the meeting point, a very well-organized lady was already waiting, dividing about 100 people into smaller groups – sorted by tours.
        </p>
        <p>
            Shortly after, our guide arrived and off we went. Tourists are now only allowed to visit the upper floor of the Hagia Sophia – a pity, but understandable. There are simply too many people around. So the lower level is closed, but the upper level offers many exciting insights. The corridors of the first floor were rather unspectacular, with the exception of some, in parts even well-preserved Christian mosaics. But the highlight is, of course, the view into the main nave. This huge dome, the endless carpet floor, the light falling through the high windows – very impressive.
        </p>

    <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>
            Especially the huge wooden panels, 7.5 meters in diameter, with golden Arabic script. They show the names of important people in Islam and hang like floating landmarks between the columns. A powerful image.

            After the tour, I briefly considered whether I wanted to quickly go into or up or through somewhere else – but then decided to stroll. Absorb the old town feeling. So I set off without a specific destination, roughly in the direction of the metro station, so that the taxi ride later wouldn't be so expensive ;). Along the way, I passed shops and restaurants that could have come straight out of "A Thousand and One Nights" – colorful carpets, spices, ceramics, jewelry, cafés with heavy velvet sofas and oriental music in the background. Very charming.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I reached the Bosphorus, I briefly considered taking a tourist boat trip between the continents. But the number of people – on the piers and on the decks of the ships – was too much for me. Instead, I looked for a restaurant by the water. The Adina is located directly under the Galata Bridge, with a view of the river. I sat there for a long time, enjoying the view and the food.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6 overflow-h margin-top-5">
        <div class="box-shadow shadow-effect-3">
            <img class="img-responsive img-center img-bordered" src="https://www.sebastianthoss.de/assets/img/blog/2024-ist-dxb/small/20240904-DSC06769.jpg" alt="The Yeni Mosque on the shore of the Golden Horn" />
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
            Eventually, I made my way back. I ordered a taxi, had myself driven to the Gayrettepe metro station, and from there took the metro to IST airport. On the train, I remembered my recharged ticket – since there was still quite a bit of credit on it, I gave it to another tourist at the airport. She was visibly grateful.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the airport follows the well-known Istanbul course: The first security check right when entering the building. Then check-in – which I had fortunately already completed yesterday – and then passport control. There I got another nice, fresh stamp in my passport. And as it should be: After that, line up a third time – for the actual security check before the departure area.
            The security area at IST Airport is huge. I didn't have much time left, but I found the lounge, treated myself to a small snack, and packed a few canned drinks for the onward flight.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I arrived at the gate, I only had to wait about ten minutes. Then boarding began – quick, efficient – and already twenty minutes before the scheduled time came the announcement: "Boarding completed". The seat next to me was free again, only in the aisle sat a man who was struggling with a proper cold. Fortunately, I had my FFP2 mask on anyway. After all, I didn't want to arrive sick in Dubai.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-12">

        <p>
            The flight itself was calm, pleasant – and offered fascinating views. We flew over Iraq and the Persian Gulf, with a view towards Iran. Even though only lights could be seen outside, the route through the night had a certain atmosphere. Somehow exciting.
        </p>
        <p>
            We landed in Dubai ahead of schedule. At passport control, everything went smoothly this time. No discussions, no questions about the ß in my last name – instead, the official even gave me a free SIM card on top. That's how a stay should begin.
        </p>

    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
            I quickly found the Europcar counter, the formalities were swiftly completed – only I didn't get the car key directly there, but only with the car itself. So on to the parking lot, through the somewhat built-up, not particularly pompous part of Terminal 1. You can tell that this is the oldest part of the airport – no shine, no pomp, but still very clean and functional.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the parking lot, I waited a few more minutes in the nocturnal humid heat at the counter there until my car was driven up – fresh from the car wash. I got a Chevrolet Groove, decently equipped and in good condition. The handover was quick and professional – five minutes later I was on my way.
        </p>
        <p>
            I avoided the toll roads, the time saved would have been minimal. The journey took 44 minutes – and that with impressive infrastructure. The highway had up to nine lanes per direction in places, plus separate on and off ramps. Scale: XXL.
        </p>
        <p>
            My accommodation, the Wyndham Residences The Palm, is located on the outer ring of the Palm Island. Even at this time, the staff was still very friendly and helpful. It was now well after two o'clock in the morning. But I was already too exhausted from the day to realize that I would be enjoying a suite with a great view for the next 2 weeks. I only briefly oriented myself in the huge room, maneuvered my head into the walk-in closet, quickly took a photo from the terrace towards Downtown Dubai, showered, and then, completely exhausted, fell into bed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Everything else? Later.

                                I'm in IT since mid of nineties and still love it.
                                After several years working in the Irish and Australian IT sectors, I returned to Germany to dive deeper into software architecture and cloud technologies.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Since January 2022, I have been responsible for production IT at Teppana in Hamburg as Head of Tech. I develop custom software solutions and leverage PHP and AWS CDK for automation to create robust production workflows.
