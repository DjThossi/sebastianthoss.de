        <p> Basti had registered for diving yesterday, and in the meantime, we learned that neither the area in front of the hotel, nor to the left or right of it, is suitable for swimming or snorkeling. Well, this could be a fun stay, was my first thought. I stayed in the room while Basti went to the diving base to get ready. I had just read the first few pages when Basti was back at the door: "There's another girl going snorkeling. Want to come? You'd have 30 minutes to get ready." Hmm, okay, he went off again and I got out of my pajamas, freshened up, put on sunscreen, got into my swimsuit, and off we went.</p>
        <p> He was already coming towards me because I was probably running behind schedule, but I was struggling with our patio door lock again. Since Hanschi had told us yesterday that it was jellyfish-free, I didn't think about a wetsuit and went straight onto the boat. On the boat, it turned out that Bianca, the other snorkeling girl, and her companion were from Hamburg. So naturally, we got into conversation. The journey to the "Blue Water" diving area went quickly, and soon we were in the water. Unfortunately, the area wasn't very suitable for snorkeling since the water depth was quite significant. Well, and then there were the jellyfish! Yes, exactly, jellyfish - so much for "jellyfish-free"! The water was quite full of them, and we both snorkelers had all the trouble getting out of there unharmed. It stung here and there, but nowhere near as badly as in Anda. I went back on the boat relatively early since there was nothing to see anyway, and enjoyed the silence of the sea until the divers came back up.</p>

        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="col-md-12">
        <p> Back at the base, we complained to Hanschi. He was very surprised that there were jellyfish and apologized several times. Well, he really couldn't help it! I then hopped into the pool and relaxed in the sun afterward. Basti had arranged with the other Hamburg woman for a second dive at noon, so we stayed at the resort. Just before Basti had to leave for the second dive, I armed myself with a towel and book and headed to the beach. "Unfortunately," I ran into the girls, and they persuaded me to go snorkeling for a second round, this time with a wetsuit. She wouldn't want to go alone, etc. Women!!!!!</p>
        <p> Hanschi gave me a wetsuit, I trotted back to the room and changed. There went the relaxed afternoon. This time we went a bit further out, the jellyfish couldn't touch us, but there was still nothing to see. The water was too deep again. The waves got stronger over time, and I noticed I was feeling strange. Damn, I had forgotten the tablets! Unfortunately, staying in the sea doesn't help me, so I climbed back on board. The boat guide helped me out of the wetsuit, and the vastness of the horizon was mine! I was sick, and the divers were nowhere to be seen. At some point, he called my fellow swimmer on board because he said he had seen the divers. Hmm, we drove and drove, and hidden behind two more boats, I saw them too. So he could never have seen them in his life. That must have been ship-to-ship communication!</p>

    <div class="col-md-6">
        <p> Basti could already see that I wasn't doing well and sent me straight to the bungalow when we were back on land. There was a cool shower and a round of dozing in bed. After almost 1.5 hours, I was finally available again, and we wanted to go back to Alona. But then we met the two girls again and decided to spontaneously eat together at the resort restaurant. Then there were delicious hamburgers, drowned in garlic for me. Basti had chicken with vegetables and potato slices. During the meal, we talked about the plans for the next few days. The girls were going to Oslob tomorrow to swim with whale sharks, and Basti planned to go diving one last time tomorrow morning. Afterward, exploring the neighboring towns might be on our agenda.</p>
        <p> We also considered what we could do on Friday. The idea was to charter a boat and go out for another round to make one last attempt to see turtles. The two girls then told us that they had already been to Balicasag and that it was very nice there, with turtles literally everywhere. We asked at the reception, and they told us it wouldn't be a problem - there would be a private boat, and the costs were 1800 PHP (about €30) including 2 companions, plus 250 PHP (about €4.50) per person. Cool! The girls had already shown interest. We decided to wait until the girls were back from their trip to Oslob.</p>
        <p> We chatted for a while until we said goodbye and snuggled up. Good night.</p>

                                I'm in IT since mid of nineties and still love it.
                                After several years working in the Irish and Australian IT sectors, I returned to Germany to dive deeper into software architecture and cloud technologies.
