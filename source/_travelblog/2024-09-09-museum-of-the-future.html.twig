            {{ page.overview.intro|raw }}: a leisurely breakfast and then some relaxed doing nothing on the terrace. Simply enjoying the sun, watching the sea glitter in the distance, and unwinding.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the early afternoon, I made my way to the Museum of the Future. The journey there was more adventurous than expected. Through the dense afternoon traffic, Google sent me through residential areas – but I eventually arrived.
        </p>
        <p>
            The building itself is truly spectacular from the outside. A huge, shiny oval ring, covered with Arabic calligraphy – a real eye-catcher and rightfully one of the new landmarks of the city.
        </p>
        <p>
            Inside, it was... let's say: mixed. The start was exciting and also a bit unexpected. Here again, you have to check in your backpack – at least I was allowed to keep my large camera.
        </p>

            The first floor, a futuristic journey to the year 2071, was impressively set up, no question. But the further you went through the exhibition, the more I missed a common thread – and especially staff who could answer questions about the exhibits.

            A really positive exception was the so-called Species Library. There I met a biologist who took the time to explain the exhibition.
            This wasn't about fictional or invented species, but about real plants, animals, and microorganisms that exist today – and which scientists seriously question whether they will still be part of our world in 2071.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many of the species presented there are already on the edge: threatened by climate change, environmental pollution, shrinking habitats, or human intervention.
            The biologist vividly explained how sensitive many ecological systems are and how even small changes can have major consequences.
        </p>
        <p>
            After visiting the museum, I took some photos of the building in darkness – at night, the Museum of the Future looks even more impressive than during the day.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then I continued on: 3.1 kilometers to Dubai Mall. I wanted to "quickly" pick up some bagels.
            Well – quick is relative. It took 40 minutes and two missed exits before I finally found the right entrance to the parking garage. But I was there at exactly the right time: Right in front of the mall, I experienced one of the famous water shows at the Dubai Fountain.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, the show is still quite short – just like eleven years ago when I was here for the first time. But the sight of the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world, makes up for everything. Even today, despite its height, it looks incredibly slim and elegant.
        </p>
        <p>
            After this detour, it was back to the hotel – with a small diversion to a gas station. Here in Dubai, there's still real full service: refueling and paying without leaving your car.
        </p>
        <p>
            And the prices? A liter of gasoline costs just 0.65 euros. For comparison: A bottle of drinking water is more expensive here. No wonder – while oil is abundant, drinking water comes from expensive desalination plants.
        </p>
        <p>
            Back at the hotel, there was another late dinner – and then straight to bed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tomorrow, the next adventure awaits.
