        <p> {{ page.overview.intro|raw }} the Elbe literally fell into the water. We decided to ignore the alarm clock, slept in and had breakfast in peace, while the rain drummed steadily on the roof. </p>
        <p> After the cozy start to the day, we checked out and parked our motorhome in the parking lot in front of the campsite. Thanks to the guest card, we were able to take the bus into downtown Pirna free of charge - an offer we were happy to use. </p>
        <p> The old town of Pirna surprised us with its charm. The small streets, historical facades and nicely decorated shop windows invited us to stroll, and we discovered sayings on various shop windows. We particularly liked the saying in the windows of a bakery café - on one window it said: "I'm so full, I don't want any Bla...", followed by the next window with "Oh, cake." Small details that stay in your memory. </p>
        <p> At the market square, we discovered a restaurant with a pleasant atmosphere and good music. Although the menu appealed to us directly, we were still too full from breakfast, so we decided to come back later. Instead, we continued to drift and finally ended up in a fabric shop. Actually, we just wanted to look in - in the end, we left with three meters of fabric in two colors. The planned sofa cushions at home can finally go into production. </p>

        <p> The nearby bookstore also caught our attention - a new book also made its way into our bag. Then we returned to the restaurant from the morning. The decision to eat there turned out to be spot on - the food was excellent, the ambiance was perfect, and we stayed for quite a while. </p>
        <p> In the afternoon, we continued to Lübbenau. A short detour initially led us to a repo market, but without any great finds. Our planned parking spot for the night was directly opposite - in front of a hotel with a swimming pool. </p>
        <p> Since we had no desire for the motorhome that day, we decided to visit the hotel bar without further ado. With a drink, a pleasant atmosphere and the new book, we let the day fade away. </p>
        <p> Back in the camper, we prepared a late dinner, watched a film and ended the day relaxed. </p>
