        <p> ___Twig_token_1___ in a space cebu was not as good as hoped, I decided to work directly from the accommodation for the two days. </p>
        <p> The plan for the two days was to build a prototype for a new software in the team to better understand where which information comes from and how we can save it in the right format. We divided the tasks and decided that I would keep a video circuit open throughout working hours and that we will meet and coordinate every few hours or when questions are. </p>
        <p> In my free time I continued to fight against the remains of the runny nose and the resulting cough. Friday morning, before work, I finally decided to take the bus to Dumaguete on Saturday. Not because it is much cheaper but because hopefully you get more of the Philippines. I booked a single room in a youth hostel in Dumaguete until Monday. First of all, see how fast the internet is there and whether I can somehow work from there. If not, I just take the plane back to Cebu and continue to work from here. </p>
