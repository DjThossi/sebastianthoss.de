        <p> ___Twig_token_1___ and we went snorkeling with camera this time. After initial "HM empty here at once" we went in a feast and we actually found seahorses and Nemos. After almost an hour, Basti had to get out of the sun and I struggled alone and pounded myself on a fish that I absolutely wanted to get in front of the camera. Unfortunately, the camera did not play along and did not put it spicy or in the end the battery was empty. </p>
        <p> To get rid of the salt, I then jumped into the pool with a camera. So that the holiday feeling would be complete, there was also a pineapple smoothie under the Mega palm trees. We spent the rest of the day relaxed again in the sun, in the sea or while working. At the end there was a pot of tea for me in the Asia-Restaurant of the hotel complex and chicken surge skewers for Basti. So an exciting day with a lot of relaxation. </p>
