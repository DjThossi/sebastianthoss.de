        <p> ___Twig_token_1___ plastic cutlery. The meaning is not clear to us in a hotel! The breakfast itself was typically American-deficient. Bacon, burger patties, bagels, tortillas, scrambled eggs, etc. Setlow was unfortunately sought here in vain. We let two bagels go with you and got it ready with a cut in the room and then moved. </p>
        <p> Since was the most wonderful sunshine, we first headed for the white house. Here we were waiting for more barriers than was previously known from the media. You didn't even get to the fence and the police and secret service people stood everywhere. Hmmm ok, in contrast to the other presidents, he simply doesn't like people on the fence - until then it was at least our opinion. </p>
        <p> We went to the other side of the White House and ended up in the "official national Christmas tree". We already knew this from the press, because because of the shutdown by the current president, the briefly unusual lighting could only be brought back to life by donating the visitors and after several hours. There are now many coins on the floor around the area of &#8203;&#8203;the tree. </p>

        <p> Next we strolled towards the Washington Monument and unfortunately everything was fenced here too. This time, however, on the basis of a construction site. So quickly just a few pictures and continued towards Capitol. </p>
        <p> However, we turned beforehand and landed at TJ-Maxx (yes it really means this), where Basti was covered with various things again. </p>

    <div class="col-md-6">
        <p> Since we were both sluggish, we only decided to go to Walmart, buy food and return to the hotel. In the supermarket we left a surprising amount of money, for surprisingly little in the car. But there should now be delicious dinner. </p>
        <p> On the way back we decided to stop at the White House again, since the sun should now be better. The photos did not become that early today because there was backlight. Arrived we first saw a hawk sitting on the meadow. He had just hunted and a squirrel in his catch. My first thought, since the squirrel was still alive, was chased to the hawk and thus save lives. But that would be an intervention in nature, so we moved on and lo and behold ... the spacious barriers were gone. </p>
        <p> You still didn't get to the fence completely, but at least a little closer. We asked a gentleman from the Secret Service what was going on, but this only replied "We sometimes block down". So we assume that we missed the guy with a red tie. </p>
        <p> Back in the hotel, we went to cook and strive not to trigger a smoke detector. Because as nice as the room is, you cannot open a window and as soon as the smoke detector triggers, it becomes damn expensive. So it is at least here in the information </p>
