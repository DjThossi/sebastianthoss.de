        <p> {{ page.overview.intro|raw }} It worked. Everything is still standing, nothing flooded, tent didn't take off - so: passed. </p>
        <p> Unfortunately, the weather forecast for our last days in Oberstdorf wasn't exactly showing its sunny side. But we're optimists (or at least like to think so), so: wait, drink tea and make the best of it. </p>
        <p> Because the sun was really unexpected in the morning, we took the opportunity to dismantle the canopy. Sure, we still had a few more days - but pack a wet canopy? It's like wet socks in the suitcase. Just no fun. So down with it while everything was still dry. </p>
        <p> Around noon, we headed to the Kleinwalsertal. Goal: the Walmendingerhorn. Sounds impressive, but drives comfortably with the cable car. Unfortunately, the train had just left when we were at the ticket counter - timing is everything. So 15 minutes of waiting. No problem, because a nice employee reassured us: "You still have two hours until the weather turns." Aha. Challenge accepted. </p>

        <p> Once at the top, there was a round of drinks and then: deck chairs! Sun! Mountain view! What more could you want? In the distance there was such a small rain curtain on the horizon, but hey - it felt like it was in another valley. No reason to worry. </p>
        <p> Well. Five minutes later we stood in the fog. Or better: in the cloud. Zap, everything gray. Welcome to the mountains! Quickly off to the restaurant before the wind blows us off the deck chair. The wind then turned up properly and the cable car was stopped. Well. So we were stuck. Well, then eat a little something. And wait. And keep waiting. And ... Oh. Now it gets worse rather than better. </p>
        <p> At some point came the announcement that you hoped and feared at the same time: "Quick down with you - we're still trying!" So: legs in hand and into the gondola. The descent felt a bit like a gentle adventure, but at least: we arrived at the bottom. </p>
        <p> Back at the campsite then the next spectacle: the storm probably didn't take a break there either. Branches, twigs, half-defoliated bushes - pure nature. It looked a bit like after a bad-tempered autumn storm in the middle of summer. </p>
        <p> Conclusion of the day? Weather in the mountains: Always good for a surprise. And we? Are ready for the next round. </p>
