        <p> {{ page.overview.intro|raw }} and this time we stayed overnight for the first time. And not by chance, but with full intention. In fact, we call ahead every time. Why? Quite simply: raisin bread. And not just any raisin bread, but the one and only true, still warm and slightly sticky inside raisin bread, as you still know it from GDR times - freshly baked at the bakery in Kaufland. </p>
        <p> We had actually pre-ordered two loaves. In the end, it became four - you know how it is. Stocked up for the next few days. Because once you've had this perfect mix of soft, juicy, and crispy, you don't want to go back. For us, it's clearly a culinary must. </p>
        <p> From there, it was only about 30 minutes to Tropical Islands - the long-awaited wellness weekend could begin. The parking spot was already reserved, so we quickly parked the motorhome, plugged in the power, changed clothes, packed our bags, and took the shuttle to the hall. And there it was: the feeling of pure vacation. Here, time just ticks differently - or rather, it doesn't matter. No checking opening hours or weather apps. Just relaxation. </p>
        <p> Our first goal: the sauna area. Between warmth, steam, and tropical vegetation, we immediately got into "vacation mode." For three days, we let ourselves drift - swimming, walking, dozing, reading. Everything without hurry, without pressure. This is what relaxation feels like. </p>

        <p> Of course, there were also things that were less relaxing - such as the now significantly grown population of so-called rainforest cockroaches. One evening we were even "friendly" surrounded, which made us seek out more illuminated corners for the rest of our stay. Sure, they're part of the hall's ecosystem, but after the long Corona closure, these little roommates had really spread out - literally. Creepy? Yes. Takes some getting used to? Definitely. </p>
        <p> We enjoyed ourselves culinary. The Asian restaurants in particular convinced us. The trips to the food court were less successful: the pizza was barely edible, the championship schnitzel was a disappointment. Even the new trend toward expensive refill cups didn't convince us - especially because many machines were already empty at lunchtime. We simply provided for ourselves - tried and true, and stress-free. </p>

        <p> At check-out, we mentioned the noticeable cockroach situation. The employee kindly explained that they're working on it - and that they're not allowed to use the word "cockroach." The animal is officially called a rainforest beetle. Aha. Sounds much more tropical. And less... crawly. </p>
        <p> The next morning, we headed back home - without long breaks, as the traffic played along and we made good progress. At home, we only unloaded the bare essentials. The rest could wait, because first there was a visit to the Ahrensburg wine festival - a small, relaxed end to our vacation. For dinner, we went to Zeitlos, before finally starting the big unpacking and laundry. </p>
        <p> And with that, our summer vacation was officially over. It started hot, went through a mixed but eventful middle - and ended in a small wellness oasis with raisin bread and rainforest beetles. Everyday life has us back now. But it won't be long before we set off again. Where will we go next time? You'll find out here. </p>
        <p> See you soon and best regards </p>
