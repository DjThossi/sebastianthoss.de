            {{ page.overview.intro|raw }} a sort of guacamole mountain with egg on top, served on soggy bread. Instead of fresh avocado, it was more like a dip mixture with what felt like two pounds of garlic. I had decided on the açaí smoothie bowl – sounded healthy, but looked sad: a mushy bowl with exactly one strawberry and four blueberries, carelessly plopped onto coconut flakes. All in all: not a breakfast you'll miss.

            After that, it was time to pack our things and prepare for today's road trip. But at 10:30 AM came the moment of shock: Check-out wasn't at 11 AM as we thought, but already at 10! So we had to hurry – stuff the remaining things into the suitcases, collect charging cables, get drinks from the refrigerator, haul everything to the lobby.

            Our Lyft driver was there just a few minutes later and took us to Sixt. There we got our new travel companion: a black Hyundai Rogue SV. Solidly equipped, plenty of space – exactly what we needed for the next segment: over to the west coast of Florida, first to Cape Coral, then on towards the theme parks south of Orlando. We'll return the car at Orlando Airport on 06/03 when we fly back to JFK.

            But before we set off on our big journey, we made a detour to Publix – our favorite supermarket so far. We stocked up on everything you need for a longer drive: water, healthy snacks, a huge sandwich for the road. Then: get in, drive off – and into the Everglades adventure.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our route took us along US-41, an endlessly long road through tropical swampland. From the passenger seat, Steffi spotted several alligators after just a short time, lying in the canals beside the road or floating lazily in the water. I couldn't always look while driving – but the surroundings were spectacular: untouched nature, lush green thickets, glittering water surfaces. No civilization far and wide, just the horizon, some traffic, and us.

            After about 75 miles came a small parking area called H.P. Williams Roadside Park. An unassuming place with a picnic table, a tree, an abandoned outhouse – and a short wooden pier right at the water.
        </p>
        <p>
            And this pier had something special: At least 15 alligators were frolicking in the water – from small to really quite large. Plus a white ibis, a heron, and even a turtle. The alligators seemed sluggish, but not lifeless: They surfaced, took breaths, swam slowly back and forth, seemed to be observing each other. One of the largest even left the water on the opposite side and disappeared between the trees – a sight you won't forget so quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before we drove on, we used the special backdrop for a little surprise: At the pier, we recorded a short birthday video for NadScho. In the background, the alligators, the dense green of the Everglades – and us in the middle of it all, slightly sweaty, but in the best of moods. A very unique postcard from Florida.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next stop was at Wooten's Everglades Airboat Tours, where we had been with friends 13 years ago. Back then, we had seen an alligator right at the pier – unforgettable.

            Today we took another break there and ate our sandwich. The heat had become oppressive by now, and the ice-cold water from the small shop on site was just what we needed.
            Just as we were about to leave, something moved in the water nearby – and lo and behold: An alligator surfaced, swam slowly closer, and curiously observed Steffi through the fence. The water was so clear that you could see the whole animal – and honestly, it was a bit eerie. After a few minutes, he disappeared again as quietly as he had come.
        </p>
        <p>
            We continued to the Big Cypress Bend Boardwalk – a fairly new wooden walkway with an impressive pavilion, comfortable rocking chairs, and a great view of the surrounding swamp. We walked about halfway along the boardwalk and found paw prints in the dry part of the prairie. Our suspicion: puma. They do still exist here, even if you rarely see them. We didn't see any – but we did see two falcons that were loudly communicating with each other over a great distance.
        </p>

        <p>
            But then we were done – the sun was beating down mercilessly from the sky, and we longed for air conditioning. So back to the car and on towards Cape Coral.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the way, we made a quick stop at Ross, one of those typical US outlet stores. There I finally found the perfume that Steffi had liked in New Jersey – tomorrow is her birthday, and I wanted to give her a little treat. Perfect timing.
        </p>
        <p>
            The last stop was at Walmart: shopping for dinner and for Steffi's birthday breakfast. I had set my mind on making her pancakes tomorrow – so eggs, pancake mix, and fresh fruit, among other things, ended up in the cart.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then finally: arrival at the vacation home in Cape Coral. Over 2,000 square feet, located right on the water – exactly at the corner of NE 17th Place and NE 2nd Terrace. A typical American bungalow with a spacious living area, open kitchen, several bedrooms, and a private pool outside, surrounded by a large terrace with a view of the canal.
        </p>
        <p>
            A large part of the terrace is surrounded by a so-called pool cage – a fine-meshed grid frame that acts like a giant insect net. In Florida, this is standard: It protects against mosquitoes, lizards, and falling leaves, without making you feel caged in.

        <p>
            This way you can sit outside undisturbed, swim, or simply let your gaze wander over the calm water – even in the evening, when the mosquitoes would normally be having a party.
            Everything was perfectly prepared, clean, quiet, and all to ourselves. As soon as we entered, we realized: Here we can really find peace.
        </p>
        <p>
            For dinner, we had something improvised from the microwave and the pot – Steffi had Asian instant noodles with frozen vegetables, I had mac & cheese, also with vegetables. Simple, but delicious – and after a day full of impressions, just the right thing.
        </p>
        <p>
            We spent the rest of the evening deeply relaxed on the sofa, both with our phones in hand, feet up, not having to think about anything.
        </p>
        <p>
            For tomorrow, deliberately nothing is planned. It's Steffi's birthday – she gets breakfast, and then we simply enjoy the day, the pool, doing nothing. We'll see about everything else spontaneously.
        </p>
        <p>
            Good night Cape Coral
        </p>
        <p>
            Until tomorrow
