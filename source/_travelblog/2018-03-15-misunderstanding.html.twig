        <p> {{ page.overview.intro|raw }} Tomorrow it's time to change accommodations again, as I unfortunately couldn't book this apartment any longer. At least that's what I thought. </p>
        <p> While I was getting ready, I received a message from the apartment owner saying that his staff is in the building today taking care of the other apartments and asking if I needed anything. I thanked him and immediately informed him that I planned to leave the apartment around 11 a.m. so he could let his cleaning team know. After a few seconds, he wrote back asking what was wrong, as I had booked until Saturday. After some back and forth, it turned out that we had been talking past each other. He said I could book the nights from the 10th to the 16th, meaning departure only on Saturday, March 17th. I had understood that I could only stay until March 16th. </p>
        <p> Now I've already booked accommodation from Friday to Sunday. This isn't very expensive at the edge of the beach, and fortunately, because every change results in the costs of the first night's stay. Well, then I have 2 accommodations for the night from Friday to Saturday. </p>

        <p> So I postponed the packing to tonight or tomorrow and preferred to work on the blog instead. I started looking for a bakery to get a dry bun against hunger and then sit down in a cafe somewhere with a milkshake. </p>
        <p> I found a nice small shop in a side street and the display said, "Calories high 15. Cookies, popcorn, cream cakes." Luckily I have self-control and only ordered one pineapple fruit shake without extra sugar. Some time later, lunch hunger made itself known and the cafe filled up. Then I made my way to a restaurant with a beach view. I stayed there for some time and enjoyed the view before heading back to the apartment, as work was slowly calling again. </p>
        <p> Oh, one more thing. I'm going diving again tomorrow. Looking forward to it. </p>
