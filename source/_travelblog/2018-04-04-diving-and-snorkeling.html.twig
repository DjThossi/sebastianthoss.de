        <p> {{ page.overview.intro|raw }} Hotel, to the left or right of it is suitable for swimming or snorkeling. Well that can be a fun stay, my first thought was. I stayed in the room and Basti went to the diving base to get ready. I had just read the first pages when Basti was back in the door "There is still a girl to snorkel. Want to go with? Would have 30 minutes to get ready". Hm ok, he started again and I get out of the sleeping clothes, freshly made, sunscreen on it, bathing clothes on and off. </p>
        <p> He already came towards me because I was probably hanging after time, but I fight with our patio door lock again. Since Hanschi had told us yesterday that it is so -free, I didn't think about a suit and went on the boat right away. On the boat it turned out that Bianca, the other snorkeling girl, and her accompaniment are Hamburgers. So of course we got into conversation. The journey to the "Blue Water" diving area went quickly and we were in the water. Unfortunately, the area was not very suitable for snorkeling, since the water depth was quite huge. Well and then there were the jellyfish! Yes exactly, jellyfish - so much too "jellyfish"! The water was quite full of it and we both snorkelers had all the trouble getting out of the number. It burned here and there, but by no means as violent as in Anda. I went back on the boat relatively early because there was nothing to be seen anyway and enjoyed the silence of the sea until the divers were back up. </p>

        <p> Arrived at the base again, we complained to Hanschi. This was very amazed that the jellyfish were there and apologized several times. Well he really can't do anything for! I now hopped in the pool and then relaxed in the sun. Basti had an appointment with the other Hamburg woman for a second dive at noon and so we stayed in the resort. Shortly before Basti had to go to the second dive, I was armed with a towel and book towards the beach. "Unfortunately" I ran into the girls and they persuaded me to snorkel on a second round, this time with a suit. Alone she wouldn't want etc. Weiber !!!!! </p>
        <p> Hanschi gave me a suit, I daked back to the room and changed. The relaxed afternoon was gone. This time we drove a little further, the jellyfish could have nothing to do, but there was nothing to see again. The water was too deep again. The waves became more and more over time and I noticed that I got strange to me. Damn, I had also forgotten the tablets! Unfortunately, staying in the sea doesn't help me and so I climbed on board again. The boat guide helped me out of the suit and the width of the horizon belonged to me! I was sick and the divers could not show up. At some point he called my fellow swimmer on board because he said he had seen the divers. Hm we drove and drove and hidden behind two more boats I saw them too. So he can never have seen her in life. That must have been communication from ship to ship! </p>

        <p> Basti already saw that I was not doing well and sent me directly into the bungalow when we were back on land. There was a cool shower and a round of dozing in bed. After almost 1.5 hours I was finally available again and we wanted to go back to Alona. But then we met the two girls again and decided to spontaneously eat together in the resort restaurant. Then there were evil-delicious hamburgers, drowned in garlic for me. Basti had chicken meat with vegetables and potato slices. During the meal we talked about the plans for the next few days. For the girls it should go to Oslob tomorrow to go swimming with whale sharks and Basti planned to go diving one last time tomorrow morning. Afterwards there may be an exploration of the neighboring towns on our note. </p>
        <p> We also considered what we could do on Friday. The idea was to charter a boat and drive out another round to start a last attempt to see turtles. The two girls then told that they were already on Balicasag and that it was very nice and that one literally falls over the turtles. We asked at the reception and there we were told that it was not a problem that there would be a private boat and the costs were 1800 PHP (approx. 30 &euro;) including 2 companions, plus 250php (approx. &euro; 4.50) per nose. Cool! The girls have already announced interest. We decided to wait until the girls are back from their trip to Oslob. </p>
        <p> We snacked for a while until we said goodbye and snuggled up. Good night. </p>
