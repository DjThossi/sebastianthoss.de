  intro: "Hello! As promised, today I want to tell you about my travel preparations. Since a Work & Travel trip to Australia isn't exactly an everyday occurrence, you need to be extra careful with the planning. There's a lot more to consider when you're going to be away from home for several months. After all, Australia and New Zealand aren't just around the corner - they're literally on the other side of the world. So careful planning is absolutely essential."
