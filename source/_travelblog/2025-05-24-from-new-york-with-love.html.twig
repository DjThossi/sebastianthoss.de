            {{ page.overview.intro|raw }} more persistent than some airport security checks. Fortunately, Steffi is still fit – at least one of us bringing energy. And it was needed today, we had big plans: "From New York with Love" – Hugh Jackman's concert at the legendary Radio City Music Hall.

            But first, breakfast was on the agenda – and a small change of plans. Originally, we wanted to go to Fleet Week and look at the naval ships. Instead, we got off the subway at 42nd Street and landed directly at a small street market by Bryant Park. There we bought a souvenir for Rosi – a pretty shopping bag. Rosi always follows our journey through our status updates and genuinely enjoys it – as if she's traveling with us a bit. Hopefully, she'll like the bag as much as we do.

            Since I was still quite weak, we decided to take a spontaneous break – at the M Social Hotel, which offers a rooftop with a view over Times Square. Steffi took the opportunity and went out onto the terrace for some photos. I, on the other hand, made myself comfortable inside on a cozy sofa – along with a Coke that was finally supposed to make me awake and fit again. And lo and behold: it worked! Bit by bit, the energy came back.

            Well-fortified (well, at least caffeinated), we made our way to Radio City Music Hall. Steffi had eaten Asian noodles with spring rolls just before – a small boost for the big evening.
        </p>
        <p>
            Arriving at the Music Hall, we were let in directly. Our first goal: the fan merchandise stand. Steffi had been raving about a very specific hoodie for months – an official merchandise item for the concert. Of course, we first got lost on the wrong floor, but at least there was a restroom there. And now comes a perhaps unexpected highlight: the waiting areas in front of the toilets! Sounds banal, but it's really worth mentioning – large, stylish rooms with armchairs and charm. Anyone waiting here stands or sits comfortably.

            Back on the right floor, we finally found the fan merchandise stand – and Steffi her long-desired hoodie. The sleeves are a bit long, but that can be altered. The main thing is she has it – the joy was written all over her face.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then it was up, way up: In Radio City Music Hall, there are three balconies stacked on top of each other. We sat at the very top, in the first row of the uppermost balcony, slightly to the right of center – seats 212 and 213. And from there we had a perfect view of a very special show.

            From New York with Love – Hugh Jackman live, with charm, voice, and heart. It was magnificent. Music, humor, stories – a worthy conclusion to our week in Manhattan. Really a goosebump moment.
        </p>

            After the concert, I needed a little something to eat – circulation and all that. Then we made our way on foot towards Fleet Week. Three large ships were docked there, but unfortunately, we could only see them through a fence. Nothing particularly exciting, but at least a check on the to-do list.
        </p>
        <p>
            We took the subway back to the hotel. The last remnants in the refrigerator were used up – once again an improvised dinner in bed. Then it was: pack up, one last goodnight movie – and early to sleep, as best as possible. Because the alarm is set for 3:25 AM. Tomorrow morning the plane is already waiting – off to Miami! Until tomorrow.
