            About time too. </p>
        <p> I got ready leisurely and packed my things. Got myself a few bottles of water and ordered a taxi to the Cebu South Bus Terminal. There was already a bus with running air conditioning ready for boarding. I had my luggage stored away and found myself a seat. During the remaining waiting time, vendors came on the bus every few seconds trying to sell their goods. From burgers, fries, nuts, donuts to cookies and Ray-Ban sunglasses. </p>
        <p> Steffi asked me the other day if there's a toilet on board the bus. I can only say no to that. Didn't find any. The bus did stop twice along the way for bathroom breaks. The toilets were even very clean and freshly mopped. ;) </p>
        <p> After 7 hours of travel including a ferry ride, I was finally in Cebu. There the bus driver dropped me off at completely the wrong place. Oh well. These things happen. So I grabbed my stuff and headed in the opposite direction. After just a few seconds, a tricycle (Tryk) stopped next to me and the driver looked at me questioningly. </p>

        <p> I showed him on my phone that I wanted to go to the Flying Fish Hostel, he just nodded briefly, and then I squeezed my luggage and myself into the passenger seat. After a 5-minute ride, we were already at the hostel. I probably paid way too much with 100 pesos (â‚¬1.50), but it didn't matter at that moment because I had finally arrived. </p>
        <p> After checking in, I spent the rest of the evening with some other travelers, and we exchanged stories and tips. I had a self-mixed Alster water to drink, which of course caused some ridicule and mockery. But I can take it. Now I'm going to hit the hay. Good night. </p>
