            {{ page.overview.intro|raw }} a bit strange: You're still traveling, but the farewell is noticeably approaching.

            The damn alarm went off at seven. Way too early – but there's no helping it. Packing quickly but systematically, so that in New York we only need to open the suitcase. Completely close the backpack and put it in the bag – ready for the flight home.
        </p>
        <p>
            One last time with the rental car. Terminal C at Orlando Airport is our destination. Returning the car at Sixt – 1,215 kilometers in total, and that with under €70 in fuel costs. Not bad at all. The Nissan SUV really served us well and was easy to drive. But that might also be due to the much wider roads.
        </p>
        <p>
            At check-in, the seat assignments are still missing from the tickets. Not a good sign – sometimes that means: overbooked flight, waiting list, anxious hoping. This time, though, just: seat assignments at the gate. Well then. Let's move on.
        </p>
        <p>
            We head toward the gate, but nothing's happening there yet. So: Plaza Premium Lounge. Unfortunately not as premium as it sounds. The armchairs are stained, the buffet half-empty – or actually: not full at all. Butter? Milk? None to be found.
        </p>

            Alcohol costs extra, and real food is only available for an additional charge. More of a waiting area with drinks and snacks than a lounge. Still – better than sitting on cold benches at the gate with a loveless sandwich in hand.
        </p>
        <p>
            An hour before departure, back to the gate. Finally seat assignments. The lady there explains friendly but firmly: Those who don't pay have to wait – others are allowed to upgrade until the last minute. But you'll definitely get on. We get 27A and B. Last row, no window. When 27C is also occupied, but D through F remain empty, I switch to 27E.
        </p>
        <p>
            The flight is bumpy – typical for this route and the last row. A little sleep helps against the jostling. Back in New York: With the AirTrain and the E-Line to the LIC Plaza Hotel.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bags into room 201, short break. Then put on the decent pants, day backpack packed – off to Central Park. A little dozing in the sun, afternoon nap on the lawn. We're both still exhausted from the flight.
            Unfortunately, there were also biting ants on the lawn. They got us a few times.
        </p>
        <p>
            Back at the hotel. Burritos via Uber – unfortunately delivered without dips, but at least tasty. Laptop connected to the TV, watching NCIS LA. Almost like being at home.
        </p>
        <p>
            To bed around 11 PM. Tomorrow still half a day in New York – then we're really heading back home. The last real evening of our trip. A quiet farewell is in the air.
        </p>
        <p>
            Good night. Until tomorrow.
