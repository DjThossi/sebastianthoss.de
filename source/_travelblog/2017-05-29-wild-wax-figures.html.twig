			First we met with Fairina Cheng, a jewelry designer, on a hot chocolate. She is the designer of the bracelet, which Steffi received for Christmas a few years ago. Unfortunately, Steffi got stuck on a door handle at the beginning of the year, with the armand break. About 1.5 months before our vacation we had already sent the bracelet to Sydney by post and Fairina even repaired it free of charge for Steffi. As a thank you, we at least give her a drink. </p>
		<p> Then Steffi and my way separated for a few hours. Steffi dawned around Darling Harbor for some time and spent a lot of time in the Sealife. On the other hand, I met Elmar, my former boss for lunch, to bring each other up to the latest state. </p>
		<p> After lunch, I first went into the wild life with Steffi, look animals and then in Madame Tussaud. She even saved E.T. And then let John McClane save himself. </p>
		<p> In the evening we went on the ship to the booked dinner cruise. Of course there were far too many people on board again. </p>

        <p> There were also no tables on the lower deck. Only chairs and the buffet. On the upper deck there were still a few tables at knee height. We promptly reserved one and Steffi was in the long line for the buffet. It took you 2 hours and offered a nice view of Sydney's Skyline and the colorfully lit buildings. The &euro; 60 for both of us with food and one drink was always worth the tour. Then we drove directly to the Circular Quay to take a look at Canon to have one or the other picture printed for at home. The rest of the evening we killed on the Vivid Festival and enjoyed the time. </p>
