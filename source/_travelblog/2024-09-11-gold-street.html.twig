            {{ page.overview.intro|raw }} doing laundry – that's just part of vacation sometimes. Since I was in a slow mode again today and didn't get out until late, I decided to drive instead of taking the train.
        </p>
        <p>
            First destination: the Dubai Frame. A huge, 150-meter-high picture frame in the middle of a park, squeezed between several highways. Of course – how could it be any different in Dubai – the frame is gilded and shines from far away.
        </p>
        <p>
            For about 15 euros entrance fee including parking, I treated myself to the ascent.
            At the top, a great view awaited me – although, like the last few days, it was quite hazy and you could only see a few kilometers. Still an impressive experience, especially the glass floors in the middle, through which you can look straight down.
        </p>
        <p>
            After that, I continued towards Dubai Creek.
            Finding a parking space was relatively easy – but paying for it... that was a little adventure in itself.
        </p>
        <p>
            Everything here runs through the public transport app. Yesterday I already had difficulties recharging my Nol Card. Today it took four (!) attempts before the payment for the parking space finally went through. Welcome to the digital age, I'd say.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the Creek itself, I first strolled through a few bazaar streets. Of course, it didn't take five meters before the first merchants approached me. Fabrics, spices, souvenirs – all "best price just for you, my friend". Unfortunately, you can hardly stop and look around in peace without immediately being drawn into sales conversations.
        </p>
        <p>
            With a traditional Abra boat, I then crossed to the other side of the river – to the legendary Gold Street.
            It was pleasantly quieter here. The merchants were present, but much more relaxed.
            I was looking for something suitable for Steffi, but gold is simply not her thing – and subtle silver was hard to find here. One or two pieces might have fit, but they were set with diamonds and were in a completely different price league.

            It was impressive nonetheless: entire robes, crowns, necklaces – real works of art made of gold and gemstones. Much of it would belong in a museum rather than around a neck.
            I actually wanted to treat myself to a small gold coin as a souvenir – one with a Dubai motif. But the price expectations of the merchants were... let's say: creative.
        </p>
        <p>
            For a small 1-gram coin, they wanted 150 euros.
            For comparison: The pure gold value today was about 72 euros, a minted coin costs around 82 euros in Germany.
            Negotiate? No chance. So I left the coin and continued without a souvenir.
        </p>
        <p>
            After this small frustrating detour, I strolled a bit more through the alleys, soaked up the atmosphere, and let myself drift. Eventually, my stomach started to rumble.

            Since I hadn't discovered a suitable restaurant on this side of the river, I promptly took the next Abra back to the other shore.
            The small wooden boats shuttle tirelessly across the Creek, and even these short trips somehow have their own charm here.
        </p>
        <p>
            Back on the other side, I found a small, cozy restaurant right on the riverbank.
            By now it was dark, and the many small lights on the shore were reflected glittering in the water – an almost magical atmosphere.
            I ordered a freshly made chicken wrap, sat at a spot outside on the street, and enjoyed the view of the Creek flowing calmly by.
        </p>
        <p>
            Full and satisfied, I finally made my way back to the hotel.

            There, I let the evening wind down relaxing by the pool.
            I sat on one of the loungers, my feet in the pleasantly cool water, while a mild evening breeze blew across the complex.
            Meanwhile, I was texting with Steffi and a few friends via WhatsApp – a bit of home on the screen, while the palm trees rustled around me.
        </p>
        <p>
            And so ended a long, but really beautiful day.
            <br/>
            See you tomorrow.
