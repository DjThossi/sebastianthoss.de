            {{ page.overview.intro|raw }} service desert Germany. No chance to rebook the flight or get a better seat without digging deep into my pocket. Well, at least I was awake and ready to go.
        </p>

            After a brief goodbye to Hamburg, I took off at 8:45 in an A320neo towards Munich. The view during takeoff was gorgeous: lush marshland, harbor gleam, and the first rays of sunshine. Even WiFi on board! Of course, I had to take a few photos of Munich Airport as we flew by. And also nice: Punctual landing in MUC, even ten minutes early.
        </p>

            From there, a direct march to Gate L24. But: 50 meters before the gate – surprise! – another extra security check by Lufthansa. After that, though, it was quiet. No lounge, no seats, just three vending machines and an overpriced mini-kiosk. Really?
        </p>
        <p>
            Boarding went smoothly, though. Seat 65A in the A380 – window seat, and luckily the middle seat was empty. The flight? Calm, almost relaxing. Only over Canada did the bird suddenly feel like a short, light rodeo. Exactly at the moment when I had taken out my laptop to do some accounting. Of course, what else? :D

            The approach to New York was magnificent – along Long Island, with a view of a seemingly endless beach. Did you know that the A380 at JFK shuts down its engines and gets pulled to the gate by a truck? I didn't know that before either.
        </p>

            The immigration? Long, but uneventful. The officer only wanted to know how long I'm staying and if I'm traveling privately. That's it. Thanks to ESTA. I was a bit worried beforehand because my address said "Unknown." There were horror stories about that on the internet... But everything went smoothly. My suitcase was already waiting – no customs check this time either.

            I had already booked and set up the eSIM in my phone 2 days before departure online through the Nomad App for a small fee, so I didn't need to look for one here. Half in jetlag mode, I walked through a major construction site to the AirTrain. On the way, my favorite phone holder got wrecked. Thanks, New York, for the warm welcome ;)
        </p>
        <p>
            At Jamaica Station, I transferred to the E line. Crowded, loud, typical NYC. Due to construction work, the line is currently running on the F route – which was actually an advantage for me because it was closer to the hotel. Small NYC bonus level.
        </p>
        <p>
            Arrived at The Flat NYC on 24th Street: Room 303, third floor, no elevator. So I lugged my heavy suitcase and camera backpack up the stairs, panting – exercise for today done. The room itself? Tiny. A double bed, mini desk, sink. The suitcase barely fit anywhere. But hey, it's enough.
        </p>
        <p>
            After that: a stroll through the Food & Crafts Market on 6th Avenue. Tested ATMs: 4 dollars at Bank of America? Nope. 3.50 at ID Bank? Alright then. So I got 100 dollars there, you don't want to be completely penniless. ;)
        </p>
        <p>
            Culinary finale: a Philly Cheese Steak from a street cart at the corner of 6th/32nd. Taste top-notch, bread rather meh. Price? 15 dollars. Welcome to Manhattan.
        </p>
        <p>
            A quick detour to TJ Maxx (the prices are still fantastic), then to LEGO (simply cheaper in dollars!) and strolled through Madison Square Park with a completely overpriced but somehow still delicious mango shake. Squirrels included – cute as ever.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course, I also took photos of the Flatiron. Or rather: of the scaffolding on the Flatiron Building. Yes, it's still scaffolded – just like at Christmas 2018. Someday I'll see it without scaffolding again. Maybe.
        </p>
        <p>
            Around 7:00 PM, I headed back to the hotel. Quickly stopped by Dunkin', repacked a bit, prepared for the train to D.C., listened to an audiobook on the side – and then around 8:30 PM, I was done. My eyes were closing. Off to bed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tomorrow, Washington D.C. awaits me.
