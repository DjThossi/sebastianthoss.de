            {{ page.overview.intro|raw }} exactly what I did, quite consistently.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although I hadn't planned anything, I was already awake shortly after eight. So I used the time for a quiet, long breakfast. Just sitting comfortably, starting the day, simply being present. In between, I had to go back to my room briefly – despite the warm outside temperatures, I was cold. The air conditioning in the buildings here runs at arctic levels, so I quickly put on a sweatshirt and continued with breakfast.

            After eating, it was back to the original plan: listening to an audiobook, feet up, mind off. I alternated between my room and the terrace – cool inside with a view, outside warm like an oven. Both had their appeal.
        </p>

            In the afternoon, I was drawn to the water. I made myself comfortable on the beach, sat in the sea for a while, let myself drift, and finally lay down under a beach umbrella – where I promptly dozed off. A really nice afternoon nap, with the sound of the sea in the background and shade on my skin. When I properly woke up again, it was almost dark. It happens incredibly quickly here – just a moment ago it was day, suddenly night. And all this before 7 PM.

            For dinner, I had pasta with tomato sauce – quite pragmatic, from a jar. No culinary heights, but exactly right for today. Simple, uncomplicated, satisfying.

            And thus ends a day that was exactly as it should have been.
