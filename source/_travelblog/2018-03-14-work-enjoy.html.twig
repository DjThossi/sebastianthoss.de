        <p> &hellip; nothing. A gray -blue wall announced worse weather. At first I did not impress myself and went along the promenade and then made it comfortable in a coffee shop with a view of the water. It doesn't take long for it to storm and rain. So I set myself comfortably with another drink and started working. When a few hours later, the weather got better, I took the chance, went shopping and then made my way back to the apartment. </p>
        <p> This morning I decided to put myself on the bus back to Dauin to make a little on the blog and get my feet into the water. In Dauin, of course, I made myself comfortable again in the Dauin Dive Cafe and enjoyed the interesting conversations with the other divers. </p>
        <p> In the afternoon I went for a nice walk on the beach and enjoyed the warmth and water. A really nice little piece of paradise. So nice and relaxed. At some point I had to go back to Dumaguete because the work called. </p>
        <p> After work I was talking to Steffi for a long time and we spontaneously found a nice little resort on the island of Bohol, which we really liked. The Blue Star Dive &amp; Resort is located on a cliff with an altar beach right in front of it. We liked it so much that we spontaneously booked it for the Easter weekend. </p>
