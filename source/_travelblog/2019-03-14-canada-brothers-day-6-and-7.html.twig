        <p> So once again, I explored the city alone. I also had to fulfill some souvenir orders. I looked at a few churches, and in the evening there were supposed to be parties at the conference. </p>
        <p> However, these were rather lame events. So we ended up having a drink in the hotel bar instead. A drink for me, and because of his medication, just a lemonade for Basti. </p>
        <p> After that, as usual, we went to bed on time. </p>
        <p> Good night out there. </p>
