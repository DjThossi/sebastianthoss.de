            On the display in the front seat, we could see exactly where we were currently.
            Steffi tapped me at some point and showed me that we were directly over Plauen. Local time 4:45.
            Somewhere down there I have family who are now in their deepest dreams and have no idea that we are so close yet so far.
            As we flew by, I sent my grandma an air kiss, and then we were already in London.
            The flight was really bad, both in terms of the unfriendly staff and organization.
            They ran out of food, both for dinner and breakfast. </p>
		<p> We had time to browse around at London Airport and have a little breakfast before we made ourselves comfortable in a rather empty plane to Hamburg.
            There was so much space that each of us had our own row.
            I slept through half of the flight, and Steffi took photos of the islands that line up like a string of pearls along the North Sea coast.
            From up here, they look almost the same as the coral islands of the Great Barrier Reef.
            I had hoped that I had slept longer and we had flown back to Australia.
            But when I saw the typical German field patterns and the many towns, it became clear to me that we were almost home again. </p>

        <p> Arrived in Hamburg, Steffi's mom thankfully picked us up and brought us home with our heavy backpacks.
            After a short afternoon nap for Steffi, we went to the city and finally treated ourselves to pizza rolls and schnitzel. </p>
        <p> All in all, we had a wonderful 5.5 weeks of vacation. There were 7 flights, 3 countries, about 3000km with the motorhome, over 250km on foot, 8 dives, 5 day tours on the reef, 2 train journeys, 3700 photos, and almost 8 hours of video material.
            We were even able to check off two more animal species on our "seen in the wild" list.
            Rock wallabies on Magnetic Island and the cassowaries at South Mission Beach.
            We only had to save the saltwater crocodile for our next visit to Australia.
            There were no major injuries except for a slight sunburn.
            Nobody got sick in between. Even the weather almost always cooperated.
            It was just a good time.
            I hope it won't be another 4 years until our next visit to Australia. </p>
