    <p>Today I'd like to start telling you about an amazing month filled with many experiences, fun, spontaneous (and rather expensive) ideas, and a minor cold.</p>
    <p>Since so much happened in February—almost daily, in fact—I've decided to break the month down into several smaller posts, similar to how I wrote about my New Zealand trip. Though hopefully a bit shorter this time.</p>
    <p>Today I want to cover the period from February 1-5, the days before Steffi arrived here. There's actually not much to report about these five days. I spent most of my time either at work or at home. Unfortunately, the weather during my free time continued to be unpleasant. I prepared to move out of my apartment, which I was increasingly happy about. First, the apartment was becoming less and less well-maintained/cleaned, and second, one day water started coming in under the apartment door. It was coming from the vacant neighboring apartment, which apparently had rain leaking into it. Since nobody took care of the water issue, the apartment began to smell, and the odor kept getting stronger.</p>
    <p>At work, I prepared everything for my one-month absence. Since we were in the middle of a project, I had to hand over quite a lot, which I hope was largely error-free so the guys could work with it without any problems.</p>
    <p>That's pretty much everything there is to tell about the first few days of February. Unfortunately, I didn't take any photos during this time. Steffi arrived the next day, but I'll tell you more about that next time. Perhaps I'll even convince her to write a post or two herself. I would definitely be very happy about that.</p>
