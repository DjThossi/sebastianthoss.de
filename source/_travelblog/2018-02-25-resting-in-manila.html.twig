            In the morning, despite the few sleep, I was awake much too early.
            The breakfast was very simple but good.
            There was scrambled eggs and butter rolls. In addition black tea. </p>
        <p> After breakfast I decided slowly, since my cold is unfortunately still annoying.
            So I enjoyed the calm on the balcony and put a round on the ear again at noon. </p>
        <p> In the afternoon I decided to explore the city a little.
            I made my way in one of the largest shopping centers here in the city.
            The Greenbelt Super Mall.
            Over 250 shops, several cinemas and a huge selection of restaurants.
            At dinner there was simply a pizza before I made my way back to the accommodation. </p>
        <p> Once there, I enjoyed the calm on the balcony before I lay down to sleep.
            But couldn't really fall asleep today.
            Tomorrow we will continue with the plane to the south of the Philippines, to Cebu. </p>
