        <p> {{ page.overview.intro|raw }} small but nice room with a well-functioning air conditioning system. What more could you want? </p>
        <p> Then I took care of my dirty laundry. It's really convenient here. There's a laundromat on the ground floor that even offers a worry-free service for a small fee. I just gave a lady there my bags of clothes, my room number, and paid. In the evening, I got my clothes back dry and folded. Almost like back home with Mom, except today I have to pay about â‚¬2.50 for it. </p>

            <strong> Thanks Mom for spoiling me in the past. </strong>

        <p> Today I wanted to visit another area of the city that I haven't been to yet. So I got two bottles of water and set off. The route was less than 3 km long, but the sun was burning quite intensely again. I had chosen the Hayahay Treehouse Bar as my destination. From there, you have a nice view over the water and can see 3 neighboring islands. When I arrived at my destination, I had finished the now warm water and first needed a mango shake and a Sprite to cool down again. I stayed there in the shade for a while and enjoyed the view from the treehouse. Unfortunately, I had to admit that I'm getting really old. Not even an hour in the sun and I'm ready for an afternoon nap? I think I'm getting old!!!! </p>

        <p> Unfortunately, the cell phone reception here wasn't very good, probably due to the aluminum roof of the treehouse. But I wanted to have good reception when Steffi arrives in Manila. I found a tricycle to take me to the city, where I first went to a supermarket to really cool down. Steffi then reported that she had a good flight and everything is going smoothly. She's staying in Manila tonight and tomorrow at noon she'll finally fly into my arms here in Dumaguete. </p>
        <p> I then made myself comfortable with a donut and a much too sweet strawberry shake (today is officially sin day) before heading back to the accommodation. </p>
        <p> There, there was continuous noise from two directions until 9 p.m. Loud music was coming from speakers at the shopping mall across the street. Live music (pop and rock) was coming from a church behind the house. Since sleeping was out of the question, I decided to work a bit and block out the background noise with my good headphones. </p>
        <p> Tomorrow I'll have my little one all to myself again. I'm looking forward to it. </p>
