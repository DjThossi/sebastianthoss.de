            {{ page.overview.intro|raw }} freshen up and shower in peace before departure. A last look from my suite at the morning Dubai, then it was off to the airport. The journey went smoothly, and since I had memorized where the car rental return was when I arrived, I found my way without any problems. The return itself was quickly done and totally uncomplicated – so I was already at the check-in counter at seven in the morning.
        </p>
        <p>
            A bit early, as it turned out, because here in Dubai there are - at least with Turkish Airlines - no automated baggage drop-off points yet. Instead, you are served personally, which also means: First wait until the counter staff arrives. But I was lucky: I was the first in the economy queue and was even processed before the business class.
        </p>
        <p>
            Passport and security control were quickly completed, and then it was by train to Terminal D, the departure area for Turkish Airlines. This terminal is by far not as modern or chic as the areas used by Emirates, but it was still okay.

            Right after that, I headed to the marhaba lounge - by now my stomach was growling noticeably. The lounge was functional, the selection of food good, and I got full. However, the furniture had seen better days, and the many marble and stone looks seemed a bit cold. But it was pleasantly quiet there, so it served its purpose. Nevertheless, after eating, I decided to stroll around the airport a bit more.
            So I also accidentally discovered the SkyTeam Lounge, which made a much more modern and friendlier impression. There I treated myself to a ginger ale and then slowly made my way to the gate.

            As on the outbound flight, I was one of the first economy passengers on board - a window seat was my goal. But unfortunately there was no window in row 8 or 9 where I was sitting. Darn. Luckily the plane was extremely empty, maybe 25-30% occupied. I could simply move one row forward and had a clear view again. During pushback, several Emirates A380s rolled through the picture at the neighboring terminal - my secret stars. It remains a mystery to me how these flying apartment buildings can take off at all - and even quieter than many much smaller planes.
        </p>

            The takeoff was towards the inland, then we turned off over the coast. And lo and behold - I did get my view of the Palm Jumeirah from above. And even a few nice photos! Further out on the horizon, the next palm island, which is currently being built, was already visible. The flight was calm, the weather clear, and so you could see places like Qatar, Bahrain, and even Kuwait City well from above.
        </p>
        <p>
            There was a warm meal on board - I chose a dish with chicken meatballs, egg, potatoes, and cheese casserole. Note for Steffi: At Turkish Airlines, apparently every dish is somehow topped with cheese - you might want to order a vegan menu in advance. ;)
        </p>
        <p>
            After landing in Istanbul, I first had to walk across the airport - and quite far. A few security checks later (drinks are of course not allowed to be taken, a pity about my Sprite from the Dubai lounge), I headed to the next lounge. The Turkish Airlines Lounge in Istanbul is simply huge. There is really everything there - even a pool table and a massage station. Since my neck and shoulders have been aching for a few days, I took the opportunity for a small free massage.
        </p>
        <p>
            Afterwards, I wasted a little more time on the computer before making my way to the gate - which turned out to be a sporting challenge. I easily walked for 30 minutes without getting far from the center of the hall. Incredible how big this airport is.
        </p>
        <p>
            The boarding went smoothly again, but around me people were already visibly annoyed and stressed. No idea whether it was due to the destination Hamburg or simply the end of the journey. But hey - I was relaxed, and that's what counts.
        </p>

            This last flight was also quiet, accompanied by a long sunset that stretched over two hours due to the time difference. Again there was good food - this time köfte, of course topped with cheese. Surprise!
        </p>
        <p>
            In Hamburg we even landed 15 minutes earlier than planned. But we promptly lost this time again at the baggage carousel. After that, it was just a quick trip to the car - and finally back home. My Steffi was already waiting for me there. Finally holding each other again, finally back home.
        </p>

            Tomorrow there will be a small summary of the trip here in the blog before going back to everyday life.

            See you tomorrow!
