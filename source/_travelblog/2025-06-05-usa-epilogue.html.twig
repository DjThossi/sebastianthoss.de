            {{ page.overview.intro|raw }} – full of impressions, encounters, favorite moments, and a few small challenges. Time for a review. For us. And for you.
        </p>
        <p>
            We walked an average of 10 kilometers per day – through city streets, theme parks, and tropical coastal regions. Always with open eyes, often with a camera in hand, sometimes with slightly aching feet, but always with joy.

            Between Sirens, Alligators, and Space Travel
        </h2>
        <p>
            A few things have particularly stuck with me: Police Week in Washington, D.C. was one of my personal highlights. Police and their cars everywhere. A nice overview of those who protect us every day, really nice to see.
        </p>
        <p>
            The air show at Miami Beach was a real spectacle: jets, helicopters, and tanker planes flying low over turquoise water – pure goosebumps. And then of course the alligators in the Everglades, seeing these fascinating prehistoric animals in the wild was breathtaking.

            Not to forget: Our visit to NASA in Cape Canaveral. Space travel wasn't a big childhood dream for me – but the technologies behind space flights, Mars rovers, and satellites have always fascinated me. In Cape Canaveral, you can feel the magnitude of human engineering. And that inspires what we can achieve if we only want to.
        </p>

            Of course, not everything went smoothly. A persistent cold accompanied me for several days in New York. And the day at Disney Magic Kingdom – with endless waiting times in hot temperatures – was more of an obligation than a pleasure. But hey, that's all part of it.

            Steffi Between Broadway and Swampland
        </h2>
        <p>
            For Steffi, it was a journey with many contrasts. She arrived in the USA and in my arms a week later. New York didn't feel quite as safe to her this time as it used to. Nevertheless, she saw most of what she wanted to see. And even though NYC is checked off her list for now – someday she'll surely be drawn back there again.
        </p>
        <p>
            Florida was also a highlight for her: the Everglades, the light, the vastness – simply beautiful. Shopping, on the other hand, was a bit of a letdown: The outlets have become significantly more expensive. "Actually, you can only shop really cheaply at Ross, TJ Maxx, or Marshalls now." Nevertheless, we still found some great clothes.
        </p>
        <p>
            A real highlight for her was the Hugh Jackman concert "From New York With Love" at Radio City Music Hall – and as if that wasn't enough, Steffi even met him on the street a few days before. Plus relaxing hours in Central Park – sun, peace, nature right in the middle of the metropolis.
        </p>
        <p>
            But she also had her lowlights: The occasionally cold weather in New York was unexpected. The overcrowded, overpriced Disney day in Orlando as well. And the return flight? Particularly strenuous for Steffi – lots of nausea, little comfort.

            Conclusion: An Adventure in Stages
        </h2>
        <p>
            Our journey began with a week alone in Washington, D.C. – for me a valuable time full of history, a little work, experiences, and personal impressions. After that, we continued together: New York, Florida – from the East Coast to the Gulf of Mexico or is it the Gulf of America? Who knows. Time to catch our breath was rare, but that was intentionally planned. And we've collected enough material for several albums full of memories.

            Orlando and the Resort Area – checked off for Steffi, doesn't need to happen again. For me it was interesting, but not unforgettable. Instead, other places have burned themselves deep into our hearts: Cape Coral, with its canals and the house with its own pool, and the beach at Fort De Soto Park with its beach and picnic vibes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, back home, the feeling remains: We experienced an incredible amount. The trip was intense, emotional, exhausting, sometimes relaxing, but above all beautiful. Not perfect – but I wouldn't do anything differently.

            Thank you for virtually traveling with us. For the excitement, for reading along, for all your messages and reactions. Now we're going to enjoy a long Pentecost weekend first and look forward to what's coming. Maybe it will soon be time for a new chapter. The next trips are already being planned.
