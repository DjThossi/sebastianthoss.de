            {{ page.overview.intro|raw }} time difference that's still in our bones. Outside, a dreary scene: dense, gray clouds hung over the city, it was drizzling, and the wind whistled through the urban canyons. A classic "stay inside" day – but that rarely stops us.
        </p>

            After breakfast, we first took our laundry to be cleaned.
            A small, unassuming laundry a few blocks away, which already appeared to us as a savior since it was cheaper than we had expected for Manhattan. With a few bags of laundry in hand, we set off, dropped everything off, and immediately felt a bit lighter – also because the question "What should I wear tomorrow?" became more relaxed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our next destination was the American Museum of Natural History – known not only for its impressive exhibitions but also through the movie Night at the Museum. I had a very specific goal: Many years ago, the museum shop had a black T-shirt with the famous NASA logo – except instead of NASA, it said NERD in the same typography. This was exactly the shirt I wanted to get again.
        </p>
        <p>
            Back then, the shop was somewhat hidden at the side entrance, but today it's located inside the museum. A problem, because: Admission now costs a hefty $30. And just to look for a T-shirt? Not really. I asked – and lo and behold: With a bit of persistence and the right smile, I actually got a free admission ticket from the supervisor marked "Museum Shop only." Unfortunately, Steffi couldn't come with me – so she waited in the entrance area while I rushed through the museum at top speed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The shop had become significantly more modern and larger, but the one shirt – my nerd shirt – was unfortunately no longer to be found. Instead, I got a small sticker as consolation. Not a replacement, but better than nothing.
        </p>

            Since it continued to rain outside and the wind was blowing quite uncomfortably, we looked for a weather-protected activity. We decided to take the cable car over to Roosevelt Island. The ride is short, but always offers a great view over the East River – even with a gray sky.

            Unfortunately, the weather wasn't any better there either. Wet asphalt, chilly air, hardly anyone out and about. We found a small restaurant and spontaneously opted for pasta and pizza – simple, warming cuisine that we needed today.
        </p>
        <p>
            But we didn't stay long. It was just too cold, too damp, and too uncomfortable. So straight back to Manhattan – this time not with the gondola, but with the subway. Our next stop was the Korean Cultural Center. It was nice and warm, quiet, and dry there. A good place to find some peace. There wasn't much to see – a few posters, some informational material – but it was the perfect place for a short break, away from the hustle and bustle of the streets.

            On the way back to the hotel, we made a quick stop at one of those typical New York stores, somewhere between clothing store, bargain market, and knick-knack paradise. A bit of browsing, a bit of warming up, and unfortunately no good deals found.
        </p>
        <p>
            Back at the hotel, we went about our own rituals: I wrote on the blog, while Steffi disappeared into her book. Outside it was still dark gray and still raining. But inside it was cozy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Later, we picked up our laundry again. The way there was a little adventure in itself today: The streets around Madison Square Garden were full of people, honking cars, and a whole lot of police. The New York Knicks had a game, and apparently half of Manhattan was out to be there. We decided not to walk in the rain, but to take an underground detour through Penn Station and the impressive Moynihan Train Hall – dry, warm, fast.
        </p>
        <p>
            For dinner today, we again had our tried-and-true fallback: cinnamon toast with peanut butter, plus sausage, cheese, and a bit of hotel tranquility. Simple things can be so good – especially when they come with a favorite series marathon. This time again: NCIS LA.

            A quiet, gray day – but just right to recharge the batteries a bit. Tomorrow, hopefully, we'll be back out in the sunshine.

            Good night.
            <br />
            Until tomorrow.
