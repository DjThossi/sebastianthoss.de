        <p> ___Twig_token_1___ The Elbe literally fell into the water. We decided to ignore the alarm clock, fell asleep and have breakfast in peace, while the rain drummed evenly onto the roof. </p>
        <p> After the cozy start of the day we checked out and parked our motorhome in the parking lot in front of the campsite. Thanks to the guest card, we were able to take the bus into downtown Pirna free of charge - an offer that we were happy to use. </p>
        <p> The old town of Pirna surprised us with its charm. The small streets, historical facades and nicely decorated shop windows invited to stroll and we discovered sayings on various shop windows. We found the saying particularly nice in the windows of a bakery caf&eacute;-on a window: "I'm so full, I don't like Bla ...", followed by the next window with "Oh, cake." Small details that are remembered. </p>
        <p> At the market square we discovered a restaurant with a pleasant atmosphere and good music. Although the menu appealed to us directly, we were still too full of breakfast, so we decided to come back later. Instead, we continued to drive and finally ended up in a fabric shop. Actually, we just wanted to look in - in the end we left it with three meters of fabric in two colors. The planned sofa cushions at home can finally go into implementation. </p>

        <p> The bookshop nearby was also taken with us - a new book also hiked into our pocket. Then we returned to the restaurant from the morning. The decision to eat there turned out to be the right one - the food was excellent, the ambience was right, and we stayed for a while. </p>
        <p> In the afternoon we continued to L&uuml;bbenau. A short detour initially led us to a repo market, but without greater find. Our planned parking space for the night was directly opposite - in front of a hotel with a swimming pool. </p>
        <p> Since we had no desire for the motorhome that day, we decided to visit the hotel bar without further ado. With a drink, a pleasant atmosphere and the new book, we let the day fade away. </p>
        <p> Back in the camper we prepared a late dinner, watched a film and ended the day relaxed. </p>
