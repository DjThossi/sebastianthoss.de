    <p> Today the day had come when my mom arrived in Sydney. I had planned the day to the last detail. From timely up to dinner in one of my favorite restaurants in the Darling Harbor. As I have had to learn many times in recent times, I am not currently going very much. </p>
    <p> So a lot went wrong today. It started tomorrow when you get up with the fact that my car just didn't want to start after just two weeks. So I jumped a taxi and drove directly to the airport when the rain is still light. There I waited forever for my mum. When I was slowly worried that she had knowledge into a control with her low English knowledge, she finally came around the corner. I explained what had happened to her, grabbed her suitcase and we put ourselves in line for a taxi together. On the way back to the van, the rain was getting stronger. </p>
    <p> A few hours later, after we had soaked a few times and the NRMA (Australian version of the ADAC) had helped us free of charge from the van, we finally drove to the hotel. We found this, only once after once and thus pay twice unnecessarily toll for the Harbor Bridge. </p>
    <p> After checking in, we made our way back to the city center with the harbor ferry. After all, Mutti was not allowed to calm down before 9 p.m. so that she could not succumb to jet lag. Since the ferry is pre -collected directly at the opera and the Harbor Bridge, for mom there was also no way of sleeping on the ship. In the meantime it stopped raining and the sun even came out. As the next, we drove up the SkyTower together to get an overview of this diverse city. </p>
    <p> Then we strolled comfortably through the city and ended up in my favorite restaurant the "Pencackes on the Rock". There we treated ourselves to Spare Ribs and then of course a portion of pancackes. They were so delicious! I can just plaster a plate fully. </p>

    <p> To Mutti's luck, the Vivid Festival was still going throughout Sydney. So also in the Darling Harbor. Additional luck for her was that even today her favorite song was built into the water and light show. After that we went a small round along the harbor and marveled at the colorful -lit opera. </p>
    <p> But then I slowly had to be careful not to fall asleep while running. It was just a long journey. When we wanted to take the ferry back to the hotel, we unfortunately had to find that our ferry would not drive in the near future. So today we jumped into a taxi a third time and let ourselves go to the hotel via the Harbor Bridge. </p>
    <p> All in all, we really experienced a lot today, even if it didn't go according to plan. I think it was still a nice and successful day. </p>
    <p> Well then let's see what will happen in the next 4 weeks. <br> Good night </p>
