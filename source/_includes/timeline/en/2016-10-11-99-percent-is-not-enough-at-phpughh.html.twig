                Today it was up to Sebastian Heuer, Kruno Knego and me to talk about a new topic.
                This time it is about testing of source code. How to achieve 100% code coverage and why it is so important not to stop there.
                This topic is quite important for us and we are proud to have 100% but to prepare this talk was not easy at all.
                How to present such a technical topic without to bore the audience.
            </p>

                I like that we managed to give such a great session and keept all listeners in line.
                Even after this 48 minutes presentation, a lot of people asked quite some questions about mocking and how to test databases.
